Hi, I'm Yike (Eric) Tan, a **Machine Learning Engineer** pursuing a Master's in Artificial Intelligence Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. I specialize in **LLM systems, model optimization, and production ML pipelines**, with hands-on experience in training large-scale models, deploying RAG systems, and building MLOps infrastructure.

I've engineered ML systems across the full lifecycle—from **distributed training on Databricks** processing TB-scale datasets, to **real-time inference services** with sub-150ms latency using vector databases and optimized model serving. My work spans **LLM fine-tuning, GPU acceleration with custom CUDA kernels**, and **production MLOps** with automated retraining and monitoring.

As a **core contributor to Self-LLM** (27.9k+ GitHub stars), I've helped thousands of developers deploy and optimize LLMs. The project was featured in **Google I/O Connect China 2024**. My technical writing covers model quantization, LoRA fine-tuning, and production deployment best practices. I've also published research at **IEEE ICASSP 2024** on zero-shot image understanding using multimodal prompting.

Currently, I'm collaborating with [Jiangtao Gong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AktmI14AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) from **Tsinghua AIR** and [Sherry Tongshuang Wu](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sherryw/) from **CMU HCI** on cutting-edge LLM applications. Check out my [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SX6jLPMAAAAJ), [GitHub](https://github.com/LikeGiver), or connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yiket/).
