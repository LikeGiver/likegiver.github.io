Hi, I'm Yike (Eric) Tan, recently graduated with a Master's in Artificial Intelligence Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University. I specialize in **LLM systems, model optimization, and production ML pipelines**, with hands-on experience training large-scale models, deploying RAG systems, and building MLOps infrastructure.

I've worked on ML systems across the full lifecycle—from **distributed training on Databricks** processing TB-scale datasets, to **real-time inference services** achieving sub-150ms latency with vector databases and optimized model serving. My experience includes **LLM fine-tuning, GPU acceleration with custom CUDA kernels**, and **production MLOps** with automated retraining and monitoring.

As a **core contributor to [Self-LLM](https://github.com/datawhalechina/self-llm)** (27.9k+ GitHub stars), I've helped thousands of developers deploy and optimize LLMs. The project was featured in **Google I/O Connect China 2024**. I've written extensively on model quantization, LoRA fine-tuning, and production deployment best practices. I've also published research at **IEEE ICASSP 2024** on zero-shot image understanding using multimodal prompting.

I've collaborated with [Jiangtao Gong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AktmI14AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) from **Tsinghua AIR** and [Sherry Tongshuang Wu](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sherryw/) from **CMU HCI** on LLM applications. Check out my [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SX6jLPMAAAAJ), [GitHub](https://github.com/LikeGiver), or connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yiket/).
