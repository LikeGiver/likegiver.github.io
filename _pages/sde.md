Hi, I'm Yike (Eric) Tan, a **Software Engineer** pursuing a Master's in Artificial Intelligence Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. I specialize in building **scalable distributed systems, high-performance infrastructure, and AI-powered applications**, with expertise in system design, performance optimization, and cloud architecture.

I've architected and deployed **production systems handling 1000+ concurrent users** with sub-150ms latency, built **distributed ETL pipelines** processing 100GB+ datasets with Spark and AWS, and engineered **microservices architectures** with Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform automation. My work spans **full-stack development** (React/TypeScript, FastAPI, Node.js) to **low-level optimization** (custom CUDA kernels, C++ frameworks).

At **Instance Creator**, I designed a **scalable FastAPI service** with async architecture and Redis caching, reducing API latency by 80%. At **Epoching AI**, I optimized inference performance by 50% through ONNX Runtime and deployed **containerized services** with CI/CD automation. My technical depth includes building a **C++/Python deep learning framework** with multi-backend support (CPU/CUDA/Metal) achieving 108x speedup over CPU baselines.

My AI background gives me a unique advantage in designing **intelligent systems**—from building RAG chatbots integrated with enterprise microservices, to optimizing transformer inference with custom CUDA kernels. Currently collaborating with researchers at **CMU HCI** and **Tsinghua AIR** on real-time AI applications.
