Hi, I’m Yike Tan, currently pursuing a Master’s in Artificial Intelligence Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. My work revolves around machine learning and computer vision, with a keen interest in multi-modal models and large language models (LLMs). I have experience as a Computer Vision and Machine Learning Engineer intern, where I applied cutting-edge AI techniques to real-world e-commerce problems.

I enjoy contributing to open-source projects, specifically around AI integrations, and recently worked on projects involving the [self-llm](https://github.com/datawhalechina/self-llm) and [llm-cookbook](https://github.com/datawhalechina/llm-cookbook).

Feel free to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/LikeGiver) for project updates, or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yiket/). You can also view my latest [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SX6jLPMAAAAJ&hl=en) here.
