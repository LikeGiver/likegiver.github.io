Hi, I'm Yike (Eric) Tan, currently pursuing a Master's in Artificial Intelligence Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. My expertise spans full-stack development, AI systems, and scalable software engineering, with particular strengths in multi-modal AI platforms, real-time systems, and automated workflows.

I have extensive experience as a Software Engineer intern across multiple companies, where I've developed cutting-edge solutions including vector-based semantic matching systems, multimodal therapy platforms, and high-performance AI model optimization. My work has consistently delivered significant performance improvements and cost reductions in production environments.

<!-- I'm passionate about open-source contributions and have been a core contributor to the [self-llm](https://github.com/datawhalechina/self-llm) project (23.2k+ stars), which was featured in Google I/O Connect China 2024. My projects range from real-time multiplayer AI games to comprehensive MLOps platforms with full CI/CD pipelines. -->

Currently, I'm engaged in exciting research collaborations with [Jiangtao Gong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AktmI14AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) from Tsinghua AIR and [Sherry Tongshuang Wu](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sherryw/) from CMU HCI, exploring cutting-edge applications in AI and human-computer interaction.

Feel free to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/LikeGiver) for project updates, or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yiket/). You can also view my latest [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SX6jLPMAAAAJ&hl=en) here.
