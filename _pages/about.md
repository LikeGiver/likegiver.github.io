Hi, I'm Yike (Eric) Tan, pursuing a Master's in Artificial Intelligence Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. I bridge **machine learning research and production systems**, combining expertise in LLM infrastructure, distributed systems, and high-performance computing.

My work spans the full stack of AI engineering—from **training and optimizing large-scale models** to **architecting scalable inference services**. I've built production ML systems processing TB-scale datasets, deployed real-time applications serving 1000+ concurrent users, and contributed to open-source tools used by thousands of developers worldwide.

As a **core contributor to Self-LLM** (27.9k+ GitHub stars, featured in Google I/O Connect China 2024), I've helped democratize LLM deployment. My technical depth ranges from custom CUDA kernels for GPU optimization to distributed ETL pipelines and microservices architectures. I've published research at **IEEE ICASSP 2024** and collaborate with researchers at **CMU HCI** and **Tsinghua AIR**.

**Looking for my specialized profile?** Check out my [Machine Learning Engineer](/mle/) or [Software Engineer](/sde/) page. You can also view my [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SX6jLPMAAAAJ), [GitHub](https://github.com/LikeGiver), or connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yiket/).
